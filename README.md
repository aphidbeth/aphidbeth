- 👋 Hi, I’m @aphidbeth
- 👀 I’m interested in molecular ecology, pests and pathogens
- 🌲 I’m currently a PDRA at the James Hutton Institute studying the microbiome of pine trees and its interaction with a commonly occuring plant pathogen.
- 🐞 Previously at University of Aberdeen looking at drivers of insecticide resistance in aphid crop pest using landscape genomic approaches 
- 📝 This is mainly a place for me to document my analysis to try and keep things reproducible!
- 📫 Reach me on: twitter @bethlilymoore or at beth.moore@hutton.ac.uk
