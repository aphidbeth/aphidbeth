- 👋 Hi, I’m @aphidbeth
- 👀 I’m interested in molecular ecology (particularly aphid genomics)/spatial ecology of crop pests
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD student at University of Aberdeen focusing on ecological drivers of insecticide resistance in crop pests
- 💞️ ...so this is mainly a place for me to document my analysis to try and keep things reproducible!
- 📫 Reach me on: twitter @bethlilymoore or at b.moore.17@abdn.ac.uk
